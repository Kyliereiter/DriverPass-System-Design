# DriverPass System Design Project

This repository contains a system analysis and design project based on a simulated real-world client scenario.

The goal of the project was to analyze business requirements and design a scalable, user-focused system before implementation.

## Project Overview
DriverPass is a conceptual web-based system designed to support students preparing for driving exams. The system includes features such as online practice tests, lesson scheduling, and administrative tools for instructors and staff.

This project focuses on design and documentation rather than full application development.

## Key Concepts and Skills
- Requirements analysis and documentation
- UML modeling, including:
  - Use case diagrams
  - Sequence diagrams
  - Class diagrams
- System design and architectural planning
- Translating client needs into technical solutions

## Design Approach
The design process involved:
- Identifying user roles and system interactions
- Defining functional and nonfunctional requirements
- Modeling system behavior using UML diagrams
- Evaluating scalability, usability, and maintainability considerations

## What I Learned
- How to break down client needs into system requirements
- How to visually model system behavior and structure
- How early design decisions impact long-term system quality

## Tools and Techniques
- UML
- System analysis and design principles
- Technical documentation

This project demonstrates my ability to think through software design challenges and communicate solutions clearly before implementation.
