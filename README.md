# DriverPass System Design Project

This repository contains a system analysis and design project based on a simulated real-world client scenario.

The focus of this project was to analyze business requirements and design a scalable, user-focused system before implementation.

## Project Overview
DriverPass is a conceptual web-based system designed to help students prepare for driving exams. The system supports online practice tests, scheduling for driving lessons, and administrative tools for instructors and staff.

This project emphasizes system design, documentation, and planning rather than full application development.

## Key Concepts and Skills
- Requirements analysis and documentation
- UML modeling:
  - Use case diagrams
  - Sequence diagrams
  - Class diagrams
- System and software design planning
- Translating client needs into technical solutions

## Design Approach
The design process included:
- Identifying user roles and system interactions
- Defining functional and nonfunctional requirements
- Modeling system behavior using UML diagrams
- Considering scalability, usability, and maintainability

## What I Learned
- How to convert client requirements into structured system designs
- How to model system behavior and architecture visually
- How early design decisions influence long-term software quality

## Tools and Techniques
- UML
- System analysis and design principles
- Technical documentation

This project demonstrates my ability to think through software design challenges and communicate solutions clearly before implementation.
