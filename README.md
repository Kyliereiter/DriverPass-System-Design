# DriverPass – System Design Project

## Overview
DriverPass is a system design project based on a real-world client scenario for a web-based driver training platform. The system was designed to modernize manual, paper-based processes by providing online practice tests, lesson scheduling, and administrative tools for instructors and staff.

This repository focuses on requirements analysis and system architecture rather than full application implementation.

## Problem Statement
The client required a centralized system to:
- Allow students to take online practice tests
- Schedule and manage driving lessons
- Provide instructors and administrators with visibility into schedules, users, and data

Existing workflows relied on manual scheduling and paper records, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and poor user experience.

---

## Solution Design
I designed a scalable, object-oriented system that supports multiple user roles and core business functions.

The system supports:
- Student access to practice tests and lesson scheduling
- Instructor tools for managing availability and lessons
- Administrative oversight and system management

---

## Technologies and Concepts
- UML Diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence)
- Object-Oriented Design Principles
- Requirements Engineering
- System Architecture Design
- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

---

## What I Worked On
- Translated client requirements into functional and non-functional specifications.
- Created UML diagrams to model system behavior, user interactions, and data relationships.
- Defined core entities such as users, lessons, schedules, and services.
- Designed a layered architecture to separate concerns and support future scalability.
- Considered usability, maintainability, and security implications during design.

---

## Key Design Decisions
- Modeled clear user roles (student, instructor, administrator) to reduce complexity and improve access control.
- Designed modular components to allow future feature expansion without major redesign.
- Used UML diagrams to validate system behavior before implementation.
- Addressed real-world constraints such as scheduling conflicts and role-based access.

## Reflection and Improvements
If revisited, I would expand early requirement gathering by developing more detailed user personas and introducing UI prototypes earlier. Earlier validation through wireframes or mockups would improve usability and stakeholder feedback before development.

---

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Analyze ambiguous client requirements
- Design structured, maintainable software systems
- Think at the architectural level, not just code
- Apply real-world software engineering practices
